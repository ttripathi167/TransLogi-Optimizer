	•	Route Visualization:
	•	Display optimized delivery routes on an interactive map (e.g., Leaflet.js, Google Maps API).
	•	Real-Time Metrics:
	•	Monitor delivery times, vehicle utilization, and cost efficiency.
	•	Input Forms:
	•	Allow users to submit new orders for prediction and optimization.
	•	Operational Insights:
	•	Visualize trends in traffic, weather, and delivery times.
8. Video Demonstration

- Real-time operational metrics (e.g., average delivery time, number of pending deliveries).
- Map-based visualizations showing vehicle locations and delivery routes.
- Deployment and Scalability: Ensuring seamless deployment as a containerized application accessible via a web-based UI, enabling scalability and ease of integration with other business systems.

**Measurable KPIs**
- Delivery Time Reduction: Achieve a 15-20% reduction in average delivery times.
