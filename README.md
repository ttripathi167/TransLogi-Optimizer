# Problem Statement
TransLogi, a growing logistics company, faces challenges in optimizing delivery operations due to dynamic constraints such as fluctuating traffic conditions, unpredictable weather, and varying order volumes. These inefficiencies lead to increased delivery times, higher operational costs, and reduced customer satisfaction. To address these issues, TransLogi requires a scalable, end-to-end logistics optimization and analytics system capable of:

- Real-Time Prediction: Accurately estimating delivery times for new orders using predictive analytics, enabling better customer communication and operational planning.
Dynamic Route Optimization: Generating optimal routes for multiple delivery vehicles by considering factors like real-time traffic data, weather conditions, and specific order constraints (e.g., priority, perishability).
- Operational Monitoring: Providing a user-friendly dashboard with:
- Real-time operational metrics (e.g., average delivery time, number of pending deliveries).
- Map-based visualizations showing vehicle locations and delivery routes.
- Deployment and Scalability: Ensuring seamless deployment as a containerized application accessible via a web-based UI, enabling scalability and ease of integration with other business systems.

**Measurable KPIs**
- Delivery Time Reduction: Achieve a 15-20% reduction in average delivery times.
- Fuel Cost Savings: Decrease fuel costs by optimizing routes, targeting a 10-15% reduction.
- Improved On-Time Delivery Rate: Enhance the on-time delivery rate by at least 20%.
- Customer Satisfaction: Improve customer satisfaction scores (CSAT) by 15%.
